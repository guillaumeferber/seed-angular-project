# SeedProject

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.0.2 and is intended to be used as a blank project.
Starting from zero, this project is designed to be used as a seed project.
You'll get:
- the very last version of Angular 
- built-in routing and two pages already created and navigatable with the navbar
- ngRX/Store, ngRx/Effects and ngRx/Store-devtools installed will allow you to use the Redux-like state management, designed for Angular.
